## To do:
- Display more data.
- Add a Title in the top navbar to indicate what this app is about. 
- Finish sidebar dropdown menus so that users can choose the data they would like to see.
- Sync top navbar with sidebar menu. For example, when users click on Countries, 
make the Countries option on the left sidebar in focus as well. 
- Create CSS files and get rid of inline style.
- Add search functionality.
